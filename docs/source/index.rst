   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Ade's documentation!
===============================

Ade (ade) is a templated file system tree manager.
Provides the ability to create and parse a folder tree structure,
from a set of fragment folders, contained in an arbitrary location.

.. note::
   If you want to quickly get up to speed consult the setup and tutorials page.
   Then refine your knowledge with command, and if you feel nerd, have a look into the reference page.

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   setup/index
   command/index
   tutorials/index
   reference/index

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`

.. warning::
    Ade is been thought with all the oss in mind, so windows, mac and linux (any other ?), but the development is been done on linux machine so the other two are lacking of testing. If you find any problem with the others, please feel free to open a ticket, I'll have a look at it as soon as possible. This message will be deleted once the compatibility is been validated.
